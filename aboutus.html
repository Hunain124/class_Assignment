        <p>In 1958, the brothers borrowed $600 from their mother and opened a pizza restaurant catering to students
            after a local real estate agent with an unrented building convinced them that pizza would be a promising
            business. Although they knew little about pizza-making or business, they learned quickly and the business
            started to grow. Their first franchise opened in Topeka, Kansas in 1959. The Pizza Hut in Aggieville, Kansas
            was the first to have delivery, an innovation. By 1977, Pizza Hut had grown to 4,000 outlets and the
            brothers decided to sell the business to PepsiCo for over $300 million USD. Frank remained the president and
            a board member of Pizza Hut until 1980.[1][3]

            The Carney brothers have been featured in the History Channel series The Food That Built America.</p>

        <p>Frank became a franchisee of Papa John's Pizza in 1994.[2] By 2001, he owned 133 locations. Based in Houston,
            his company runs stores in Kansas, Arizona, Missouri, California, Texas and Hawaii, including several in his
            hometown of Wichita and the suburbs of Derby and Andover, under the franchise name PJ Wichita LLC., before
            selling the franchise to then Franchise President Terry Newman. During legal struggles with Pizza Hut in the
            late 1990s, Papa John's ran commercial advertisements highlighting the fact, including a dramatization
            showing Frank coming to a Pizza Hut stockholders' meeting wearing a Papa John's apron, saying, "Sorry, guys.
            I found a better pizza.</p>

        <h2>HISTORY OF PIZZA HUT</h2>
    </center>
    <p>Pizza Hut was launched on May 31, 1958,[6] by two brothers, Dan and Frank Carney, both Wichita State students, as
        a single location in Wichita, Kansas.[7] Six months later they opened a second outlet, and within a year they
        were operating six locations.[8]

        One early employee was future Pro Football Hall of Fame head coach Bill Parcells, who had worked for the company
        while a college student and football player at Wichita State University. Parcells was considering a franchise
        for a career (as well as law school), but instead chose to enter coaching, eventually becoming a head coach in
        the National Football League.[9]

        The brothers began franchising in 1959. The iconic Pizza Hut building style was designed in 1963 by Chicago
        architect George Lindstrom[10] and was implemented in 1969.[8]</p>
